//! The test contract, checked: THE ORACLE TOOLS RUN IN THE HARNESS VM
//! AND NOWHERE ELSE, the kernel is only ever asked in the guest, and no
//! test announces a skip.
//!
//! Why the host is forbidden rather than merely second choice:
//! squashfs-tools on a workstation is whatever that machine has — Debian 12
//! packages 1.5, Ubuntu 24.04 packages 1.7.1, neither knows the options
//! the writer tests use, most packaged builds cannot write ZSTD at all,
//! and on a Mac there is no SquashFS. One version, in one guest, answers
//! the same way for everyone. So a test that spawns `unsquashfs` itself
//! is refused here even when it would work on the machine that wrote it.
//!
//! `chore test:unit`, `chore test:oracle` and `chore test:kernel` are
//! chosen by `scripts/test-targets.sh` from what each test file calls:
//! `fs_squashfs_test_support::oracle` / `assert_unsquashfs_walks` /
//! `mksquashfs_from_guest_tree` for a tool, the kernel helpers for a mount, or
//! a path under the fixture directory for an image. That is only sound while those are the only
//! ways in: a test that spawned a tool by name would be classified as a
//! unit test, run on the `unit` CI job with no VM, and — worse — be free
//! to return early when the tool is absent, which is the silent pass the
//! contract exists to end. So this file reads every test source and
//! refuses every other shape.
//!
//! It names the patterns it looks for without spelling them out, so that
//! this file itself stays in the unit tier.
