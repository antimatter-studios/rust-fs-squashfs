///
/// ONE RULE, AND IT IS THE ORACLE'S — BUT IT ONLY APPLIES ONE WAY ROUND.
///
/// When the tests run on the HOST, scratch files are what the oracle
/// tools read, and those tools run in the harness VM, which sees this
/// repository mounted at the path the host knows it by — and nothing
/// else of the host. A scratch directory under `/tmp` or `$RUNNER_TEMP`
/// would not exist there. So it lives in the repository (gitignored), on
/// every machine and on CI alike, and a caller-supplied directory
/// outside the repository is refused rather than quietly breaking every
/// oracle test.
///
/// WHEN THE TESTS RUN INSIDE THE GUEST, THAT RULE INVERTS: the
/// repository is the 9p MOUNT, and it is the one filesystem the tools
/// must not work on. `mksquashfs` mmaps its output for `-Efragments` and
/// `-m65536`, and mmap on virtio-9p does not support what it needs.
/// Measured on CI run 36243473053, the same two commands, same squashfs-tools
/// build, same guest — only the directory differs:
///
/// | job | image path | `mksquashfs -Efragments` |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | `test (x86_64, oracles in the VM)` | host path, tool called over ssh | `-> 0` |
/// | `suite in the guest` | `/repo/tmp/...` (9p) | `-> 139` (SIGSEGV) |
///
/// A segfault is not a refusal, so there was nothing to report but an
/// exit status: `mksquashfs ["-zlz4hc", "-Efragments"] failed: left:
/// Some(139)`. It passed locally on an aarch64 host, which is why it
/// reached CI — the 9p implementations differ, and that is precisely the
/// kind of difference a scratch directory should not be exposed to.
///
/// So in the guest, scratch goes on the guest's OWN disk. Nothing is lost:
/// in that direction there is no host to be invisible to, and the guest
/// keeps its own copy of everything a tool needs.
