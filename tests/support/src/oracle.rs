//! The oracle tools, run where the filesystem they belong to lives: IN
//! THE HARNESS VM, never on the host.
//!
//! WHY NOT ON THE HOST. squashfs-tools on a workstation is whatever that
//! machine happens to have, and for this format that is worse than
//! usual: Debian 12 packages 1.5, Ubuntu 24.04 packages 1.7.1, and
//! neither knows the variable block size this crate's writer emits or
//! prints the `Filesystem blocksize:` line the writer tests read. Most
//! packaged builds also lack ZSTD entirely, because `mksquashfs` only
//! compiles that codec in when libzstd was present at configure time —
//! so `-zzstd` is refused on exactly the machines where nobody notices.
//! An oracle whose answer depends on which laptop asked is not an
//! oracle. So there is ONE place the tools exist: the Debian guest the
//! harness boots, where `scripts/vm-setup.sh` builds squashfs-tools 1.9.1
//! from source with every codec, and which is also the guest that
//! builds the fixtures and runs the kernel oracle. A Mac needs no
//! squashfs-tools at all, and every machine gets the same answers.
//!
//! WHY IT IS NOT SLOW. The VM is booted once for a suite (`chore
//! test:oracle` brings it up and holds it) and every call rides one
//! multiplexed SSH connection — about 30 ms of overhead per tool
//! invocation, against 700 ms for a fresh connection. Nothing is copied:
//! the harness mounts this repository in the guest AT THE SAME ABSOLUTE
//! PATH the host uses, so an image at `<repo>/tmp/x.img` is that same
//! path in the guest, and the arguments cross unchanged.
//!
//! THAT IS ALSO THE ONE RULE A TEST MUST KEEP: everything a tool touches
//! lives inside this repository ([`crate::temp_dir`] and `test-disks/`
//! both do). A path outside it fails here, naming the rule, rather than
//! producing a puzzling "No such file or directory" from the guest.
//!
//! WHEN THE SUITE ITSELF RUNS IN THE GUEST (`chore test:vm`, which is
//! how a Mac runs the Linux suite at all), there is no VM to ask: this
//! IS it. The harness says so with `FLTH_GUEST=1` in every command it
//! runs there, and the tool is then spawned directly. That is the same
//! rule, not a second one — the tools run in the harness's Debian guest
//! and nowhere else; only the distance to it changes.
//!
//! NOTHING SKIPS. A missing harness, a VM that will not boot, a tool the
//! guest does not have: each fails the test that needed it, naming the
//! task that fixes it.

/// read it over the mount — but the xattr oracles cannot. The repository
/// reaches the guest as a 9p mount with `security_model=none`, so
/// whether a `user.*` attribute set on one side is visible on the other
/// is a property of the host's filesystem and of the transport, not of
/// SquashFS. A test whose subject is "did `mksquashfs` put this attribute in
/// the shared xattr area" cannot also be a test of that. So the staging
/// runs on the guest's own disk, where `setfattr` means what it says,
/// and only the finished image crosses back.
///
/// `stage` is a `bash -euo pipefail` script run with the empty source
/// directory as its working directory; `$SRC` also names it. Its
/// failure is the call's failure — there is nothing to skip.
///
/// ONE GUEST CALL for the staging and the build together.
///
/// NOTE THE ARGUMENT ORDER, which is the reverse of the sibling drivers'
/// formatters: `mksquashfs SOURCE DEST [options]`, where `mkfs.erofs` and
/// `mkfs.xfs` take the destination first. Getting it the wrong way round
/// does not fail loudly — `mksquashfs` would treat the image path as a
/// source and the tree as the output — so the order is spelled out here
/// rather than left to whoever reads the format string next.
