//! THE KERNEL ORACLE: the real in-kernel SquashFS driver, reading back what
//! this crate wrote.
//!
//! `unsquashfs` is a second opinion on the same file format, written by
//! the same project, from the same specification. Linux is the thing the
//! images are actually for — SquashFS exists to be mounted from a source
//! you did not produce, so the mount path is the one that matters. An
//! image `unsquashfs` calls clean can still be one the kernel mounts
//! differently: a directory entry it will not find, a compressed extent
//! it decodes shorter than we wrote it, an xattr it puts in another
//! place. Nothing on the host can catch that — a loop mount is the
//! kernel's job, it needs root, and macOS has no SquashFS at all.
//!
//! So a kernel oracle is a script run INSIDE the harness VM against a
//! loop mount of one of our images. It is the only place in this suite
//! where a filesystem is mounted, and it never happens on the host.
//!
//! THIS REPLACED A `sudo -n mount` FROM INSIDE A TEST. That version
//! could only run on a Linux runner with passwordless sudo, so a
//! developer's machine never ran it at all, and for most of its life it
//! matched the refusal against a list of permission-denied wordings,
//! printed "skipping" and returned ok (#117). In the guest there is
//! nothing to be refused and nothing to skip: a mount that does not
//! happen fails the test.
//!
//! ONE GUEST CALL PER CHECK. The script does the whole comparison —
//! mount, walk, hash, read xattrs, unmount — and prints what it found,
//! rather than paying a round trip per question.
//!
//! THE IMAGE IS COPIED INTO THE GUEST'S OWN DISK for the mount. A loop
//! mount reads through the page cache; pointing that at a file on the 9p
//! share mixes two caches over one file. The copy costs a fraction of a
//! second for these images and removes the question. SquashFS is read-only,
//! so there is no copy back: the kernel cannot have changed it.
