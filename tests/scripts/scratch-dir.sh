# Tests for scripts/test.sh's choice of scratch directory, which differs
# depending on WHERE the suite is running and gets it wrong silently.
#
# From the host, scratch must be inside the repository: the oracle tools run in
# the harness VM, which sees this repository at the path the host knows it by
# and nothing else, so an image anywhere else is a path the tool cannot open.
#
# Inside the guest (FLTH_GUEST=1) it must be on the guest's OWN disk, because
# /repo is a virtio-9p share and mmap over 9p does not support what mksquashfs
# asks of it for -Efragments and -m65536. That failure is a SIGSEGV, not a
# refusal: exit 139 with nothing to report. It passes on an aarch64 host and
# fails on CI's x86_64 guest (run 36243473053), so nothing local catches a
# regression here — hence this file.
#
# Why a shell test and not a Rust one: tests/support/src/lib.rs makes the same
# choice and is covered by its own unit tests, but scripts/test.sh EXPORTS
# FS_SQUASHFS_TEST_TMPDIR, so whatever this script picks is what the Rust default
# never gets asked about. This is the copy that wins, so this is the copy that
# needs a guard.
