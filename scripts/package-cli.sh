#
# Package the built command-line tools as a release tarball in the current
# directory, check it, and print its file name on stdout.
#
#   <version>     the release version, without the leading `v`
#   <label>       the platform, e.g. darwin-arm64 or linux-x86_64
#   [target-dir]  where cargo put the release build (default: target/release)
#
# THE TARBALL IS THE CONTRACT with whatever installs it. Its layout is an
# install prefix, the same in every repository of the family, so an
# installer copies it as-is and needs to know nothing about which tools are
# in it:
#
#   bin/<repo>                          the multi-call binary, the real file
#   bin/<tool>...  -> <repo>            each dotted name, a relative symlink
#   share/man/man1/, share/man/man8/    man pages, one per name and subcommand
#   share/zsh/site-functions/_<name>
#   share/bash-completion/completions/<name>
#   share/fish/vendor_completions.d/<name>.fish
#   share/<repo>/CAVEATS                at most four lines an installer shows
#   LICENSE
#
# <repo> is the repository's name, from Cargo.toml's `repository`, and is
# the binary's own name. Cargo refuses a dot in a target name, so the dotted
# names exist only as the symlinks made here: no build-system name reaches a
# published artifact. The man pages and completions are written by the
# binary itself (`<repo> generate man|completions`), so they describe the
# flags the program actually takes.
#
# THEN IT CHECKS WHAT IT BUILT, because a tarball whose tools do not run is
# worse than no tarball: the failure would surface as a user's bug report
# rather than a red release. The dotted names are written down HERE, not
# read from the binary alone, so a binary that forgot one cannot agree with
# itself. Every file outside the layout above is refused; every name must
# be a relative symlink to bin/<repo>, answer --help, report `<tool>
# (<crate>) <version>` for this version, and have its man page and its three
# completions. On any failure nothing is printed on stdout and the tarball
# is removed. tests/scripts/test-package-cli.sh holds this script to all of
# that.
